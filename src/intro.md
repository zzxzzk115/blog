A game developer who likes electronic products, vocal music and arrangement.

At present, I work for BlackJack Studio, a game studio owned by Zilong Games, major in game server development, and occasionally learns content related to game client development and Computer Graphics.

My familiar languages are C# and C++. I'm like a Microsoft programmer. I've been watching .NET full-stack recently. Personally, I think .NET is still very promising.

My familiar game engine is mainly Unity, and I also know a little bit of other small frameworks such as love2d and pygame.

I hope that I can communicate with like-minded programmers and game developers about technologies.
