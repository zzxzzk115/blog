对于做阅读题而言，我们不需要完全读懂一篇文章，我们只需要找到关键的定位词和中心句就能拿到不错的分数。但是，一旦有些题目需要你推断作者的真正观点，你至少需要读懂文章每个段落在具体阐述什么内容。如果我们最终由于存在生词，或者读不通长难句，导致丢分，则说明我们平时没有怎么进行过精读。

通过精读，我们可以积累丰富的阅读词汇，并认识和了解一些人们经常讨论的话题相关的知识，拓宽我们的视野。通过精读，也能攻克长难句读不通的问题。

### Why real Christmas trees are better for the environment

> Less CO2 emissions, health benefits and recycling options mean real trees are more environmentally friendly than artificial ones

We often think that buying an artificial tree will save a lot of waste in the long run because, well, we can reuse it every single year. However, this ==argument== doesn’t consider that the tree is made of materials that still won’t have decomposed long after we’re gone and, when the tree is being made, a lot of CO2 emissions are being let off into the atmosphere. By ==opting== for an artificial tree people believe that they are helping the environment by not cutting down trees, however, increased demand for real trees is actually helping the environment.

#### Carbon emissions of creation

At the heart of the debate is the carbon emissions created by each tree. Artificial trees, when they are created, emit on average 40kg of CO2. This is not including the transport emissions of them, as they are not often made locally. To harvest a real Christmas tree, very little emissions are caused, and when there is a ==plethora== of Christmas tree farms here in the UK, these trees are locally sourced, and will use a tiny amount of CO2 during transport when compared to the plastic trees ==flown== across continents.

#### Carbon emissions of disposal

However, how a tree is disposed of is ==detrimental== to how much CO2 it emits. British ==carbon trust== estimates that a real tree recycled into ==splinters== for woodwork or burnt as firewood on average emits 3.5kg of CO2. ==Whereas== if the tree ends up in ==landfill==, the ==gases== it releases as it decomposes increases its footprint to approximately 16kg of CO2, and doing the same with a new tree every year will add up.

However, this doesn’t consider the amount of CO2 that tree has captured over its lifetime and effectively ==cancels out==. By the time the tree is harvested, it will have absorbed a total of 18kg of CO2. In other words, a hectare planted with Christmas trees absorbs approximately 11,000kg of CO2 annually, sufficiently ==making up== for the little amount of CO2 its disposal creates.

#### ==Degradation== of trees

If left to ==biodegrade==, a real tree will return to the earth in one to two years depending on conditions. An artificial tree, however, will take hundreds of years to degrade, releasing more ==toxins== into the air as it does. Further, even if an artificial tree is recycled, as many of them contain oil by-products, the process will continue to generate even more CO2. Also, artificial trees often contain chemicals that poison children and pets, as well as ==contaminate== the air.

#### Health benefits

Real trees do not have these problems, and according to research, they can have positive effects on our health. ==Evergreen== trees produce not only clean oxygen when ==photosynthesising==, which they will continue to do so indoors if near a window and regularly watered, but, also ==phytoncide==, a chemical that can fight infections and boost our immune systems.

#### Tree nurseries

However, cutting down trees, and ==deforestation== is bad for the environment, so what makes cutting down Christmas trees any different? Christmas trees have specific nurseries that they are harvested from, meaning that protected forests aren’t cut down, and, with every tree harvested a new one is planted. The trees aren’t harvested until they are between ten and 12 years old, and the farms constantly have trees growing while they’re harvesting this year’s batch of trees.

It is estimated that seven million trees are sold each year, according to the British Christmas Tree Growers Association, which means that the trees sold in a single year have absorbed over 126 million kg of CO2 in their lifetime. Because of the demand for real trees in the UK, we are able to keep hold of ==green belt land== for these nurseries, and sufficiently absorb millions of kilograms of carbon every single year. Whereas plastic trees will only increase the amount of CO2 in the air.

#### If you do use an artificial tree

If you use an artificial tree, the best thing you can do is keep using it to save it from going to landfill, and over time it would spread the cost of its initial emissions over each year you’re using it.

#### Recycling real trees

For real Christmas trees, there are several ways to dispose of them in a ==sustainable== way. Individually, you can chip the tree into ==mulch== for your own garden, or many councils will set up tree collection or drop off points to use the mulch in community projects.

If you’re wanting to find a solution to recycling the tree, there are tree farms where you can rent a ==potted tree==, and then once Christmas is over, it will be collected and replanted until next year. Another option is buying a potted tree and planting it in your own garden as replanting significantly reduces its carbon footprint, and ensures you always have a tree waiting to be decorated.

中心思想：

真实的圣诞树比人造的圣诞树更环保，降解时间更短，二氧化碳排放量更少，栽培简单，回收方便，也更健康。如果选择购买人造圣诞树，最好多留一段时间，而不是买来过完节就扔了，因为它实在是太难降解了，且排放的有毒气体会污染空气，不利于身心健康。
