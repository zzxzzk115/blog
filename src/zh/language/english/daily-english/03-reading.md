### Why real Christmas trees are better for the environment

> Less CO2 emissions, health benefits and recycling options mean real trees are more environmentally friendly than artificial ones

We often think that buying an artificial tree will save a lot of waste in the long run because, well, we can reuse it every single year. However, this ==argument== doesn’t consider that the tree is made of materials that still won’t have decomposed long after we’re gone and, when the tree is being made, a lot of CO2 emissions are being let off into the atmosphere. By ==opting== for an artificial tree people believe that they are helping the environment by not cutting down trees, however, increased demand for real trees is actually helping the environment.

#### Carbon emissions of creation

At the heart of the debate is the carbon emissions created by each tree. Artificial trees, when they are created, emit on average 40kg of CO2. This is not including the transport emissions of them, as they are not often made locally. To harvest a real Christmas tree, very little emissions are caused, and when there is a ==plethora== of Christmas tree farms here in the UK, these trees are locally sourced, and will use a tiny amount of CO2 during transport when compared to the plastic trees ==flown== across continents.

#### Carbon emissions of disposal

However, how a tree is disposed of is ==detrimental== to how much CO2 it emits. British ==carbon trust== estimates that a real tree recycled into ==splinters== for woodwork or burnt as firewood on average emits 3.5kg of CO2. ==Whereas== if the tree ends up in ==landfill==, the ==gases== it releases as it decomposes increases its footprint to approximately 16kg of CO2, and doing the same with a new tree every year will add up.

However, this doesn’t consider the amount of CO2 that tree has captured over its lifetime and effectively ==cancels out==. By the time the tree is harvested, it will have absorbed a total of 18kg of CO2. In other words, a hectare planted with Christmas trees absorbs approximately 11,000kg of CO2 annually, sufficiently ==making up== for the little amount of CO2 its disposal creates.

#### ==Degradation== of trees

If left to ==biodegrade==, a real tree will return to the earth in one to two years depending on conditions. An artificial tree, however, will take hundreds of years to degrade, releasing more ==toxins== into the air as it does. Further, even if an artificial tree is recycled, as many of them contain oil by-products, the process will continue to generate even more CO2. Also, artificial trees often contain chemicals that poison children and pets, as well as ==contaminate== the air.

#### Health benefits

Real trees do not have these problems, and according to research, they can have positive effects on our health. ==Evergreen== trees produce not only clean oxygen when ==photosynthesising==, which they will continue to do so indoors if near a window and regularly watered, but, also ==phytoncide==, a chemical that can fight infections and boost our immune systems.

#### Tree nurseries

However, cutting down trees, and ==deforestation== is bad for the environment, so what makes cutting down Christmas trees any different? Christmas trees have specific nurseries that they are harvested from, meaning that protected forests aren’t cut down, and, with every tree harvested a new one is planted. The trees aren’t harvested until they are between ten and 12 years old, and the farms constantly have trees growing while they’re harvesting this year’s batch of trees.

It is estimated that seven million trees are sold each year, according to the British Christmas Tree Growers Association, which means that the trees sold in a single year have absorbed over 126 million kg of CO2 in their lifetime. Because of the demand for real trees in the UK, we are able to keep hold of ==green belt land== for these nurseries, and sufficiently absorb millions of kilograms of carbon every single year. Whereas plastic trees will only increase the amount of CO2 in the air.

#### If you do use an artificial tree

If you use an artificial tree, the best thing you can do is keep using it to save it from going to landfill, and over time it would spread the cost of its initial emissions over each year you’re using it.

#### Recycling real trees

For real Christmas trees, there are several ways to dispose of them in a ==sustainable== way. Individually, you can chip the tree into ==mulch== for your own garden, or many councils will set up tree collection or drop off points to use the mulch in community projects.

If you’re wanting to find a solution to recycling the tree, there are tree farms where you can rent a ==potted tree==, and then once Christmas is over, it will be collected and replanted until next year. Another option is buying a potted tree and planting it in your own garden as replanting significantly reduces its carbon footprint, and ensures you always have a tree waiting to be decorated.

### 10 Ways to remember a loved one at Christmas

> Grief is always difficult, but Christmas in particular can bring up some tough emotions. Here are some tips for dealing with grief at Christmas

Grief is the price we pay for love, and no-one knows the depth and width of our relationship with someone we have lost. Each of us is coping with our own feelings and sadness. 

It can feel easier to slip beneath Christmas and “just let it happen”. However, if your sadness prevents you from being able to share all of the joy your loved one brought to your life, the legacy of love becomes lost, not only to others, but to you too. 

We have a duty to those we love and to those still in our lives, to carry on, especially if we have children. But equally we have to communicate when we are struggling so we can have our “grief” time. We all need this.

#### Have a plan

Get together and talk with your family about how each of you may feel in the run up to Christmas and also on the day so you can each accept whatever feelings come up and make allowances for them. There may be something special you want to do to remember individually or collectively as a family. This can help to give you a focus on the run up to Christmas day. 

#### New traditions

Try creating some new traditions. Buy a lovely Christmas card to your loved one, write in it a special message and hang it on the tree. By doing things differently, we can make ourselves feel different. Old rituals and routines can be hard to let go and maybe we can feel that this will take us further away from our loved one, but we have to find ways to move forward and yet still keep them close. 

The truth is, you can never, ever forget someone you love and our emotional relationship with that person will continue for as long as we live. Finding new traditions can give us a chance to discover the things we that we need to get through. Sometimes if we keep doing Christmas the same, it can make their absence harder to bear. 

#### Memory hour

Schedule a special time where you each allow one another the opportunity to tell your own story about your relationship with the person who has died. You have a lifetime of memories bubbling up and one of the best things you can do is to share those memories. 

Take turns and don’t interrupt when someone is speaking as this can stop the emotion. Allow tears, allow laughter. Yes, there may be tears and longing, but we have to embrace the life of memories made together. Taking the time to honour their memory almost gives us permission to find joy in the day. Everything in nature has to have a balance.

Also, it can be quite lovely to hear how unique each of our relationships are. Helping us to identify and share those special things that are ours alone with that one person can create its own balm of healing. So many different versions of them, but all fundamentally based on the same values and character. Sharing our memories is a powerful act. 

#### Accept it may be a challenge for you

Make it ok not to be ok and if you feel yourself folding, take some time on your own. However, if you feel that you are withdrawing more and more, then you may need to reach out for help. 

Our grief and sadness need our attention and the hurting heart needs expression. Allowing ourselves to feel our feelings in the moment can relieve some of the pressure within. Be wary of quick fix relievers such as alcohol and overeating—they only really serve to distract us, for a short time, from the feelings we really need to feel to make progress in our journey of grief. 

#### Tears and laughter

Don’t berate yourself when you have your happy moments and lose yourself in the here and now (which you will). It means you have slipped into the present moment without thought of past or future. This gives our hearts and minds respite from the pain, and we are coming up for air. 

We then remember and go back to grieving; this is perfectly healthy and normal. Grief is not a straight line, and we must rise and fall with it, to trust our instincts and not let ourselves be influenced by others or what we think they expect of us. If you need to cry, let your tears come and, equally if you need to laugh, know that that’s ok. Both emotions need equal expression.

#### Reach out

Don’t  be afraid to pick up the phone and contact those who were special in the life of the person you have lost. This creates a community centred around your special person and a support network for each of you.

#### We need laughter

Choose a super Christmas movie. Some of the old classics are fabulous and funny! Watch a good comedy and laugh along. Laughter releases endorphins into our bodies which can dissipate some of the chemical residue of grief. 

#### Remembering

Light a candle for your loved one, perhaps next to their photo. Pour their favourite drink and take turns to say what you miss most about them and the one thing you would like to tell them (even though they may have heard it before). Have a morning walk. Add comments, pictures and keepsakes from the day to your memory box, if you have one. 

Journalling is magical and the power of the pen can better than medicine. Find a lovely book that is yours alone and write your heart’s words—happy, sad, good, bad. No-one needs to read it unless you want them to. Putting our feelings down on paper can identify areas where we are stuck or areas we need help with.

#### You matter too

Self-care is paramount. Climb into a nice hot bath and relax. Light candles and play soft music. A hot bath is really nurturing especially with some aromatherapy bubbles or magnesium flakes which have great cleansing and calming properties. 

#### Have a plan moving forward

As we approach the end of any year, we turn our thoughts to changes we would like to make and even though we may be wishing for our loved one back, we have no choice. If we don’t change anything, nothing will change. 

Make a resolution to tend to yourself emotionally. Never be afraid to share a favourite memory or mention the name of your special person. By doing so, you will make others a part of your journey and memory is how we hold on to the things we love. 

We don’t have relationships because they last forever, we have them because of the wonderful experience, the giving and receiving of love. By sharing your experiences with those significant in the life of your loved one, it builds bridges to them and, more importantly, connects us to the energy of the one we love.
