## Functions

A one-to-one mapping from the domain to the range:

$$f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$$

:::info Note
$\mathbb{R}$ represents the one-dimensional real number domain.

### Height Maps

A height map can be described as:

$$f: \mathbb{R^2} \to \mathbb{R}$$

A height map is a 2D image where each pixel records a height value. It is commonly used to represent terrain.

### 2D Parametric Curve

$$f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R^2}$$

In other words: $f(t) = p$ where $p$ is a two-dimensional coordinate point (x, y).

### 3D Parametric Curve

$$f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R^3}$$

In other words: $f(t) = p$ where $p$ is a three-dimensional coordinate point (x, y, z).

### Texture Mapping

The relationship mapping a texture to an object's surface can be described as:

$$f: \Omega \to \mathbb{R^3}$$

Here, $\Omega$ represents the texture domain (u, v), and $\mathbb{R^3}$ represents the spatial domain (x, y, z).
